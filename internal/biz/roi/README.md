# ROI Module

This module handles ROI (Return on Investment) tracking and value measurement for Lighthouse:

- Baseline comparison (Day 0 snapshot vs current metrics)
- Financial savings calculation (zombie cleanup, optimization gains)
- Efficiency gains tracking (resource utilization improvements)
- Node reduction metrics
- Automated ROI reporting and dashboards

This is a placeholder file. Actual implementation will be added in later phases.
