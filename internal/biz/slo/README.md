# SLO Module

This module handles SLO (Service Level Objective) monitoring and diagnostics for Lighthouse:

- SLO calculation from Ingress/Gateway access logs
- Dynamic SLO monitoring (Global → Namespace → Service level)
- Contextual snapshot generation on SLO violations
- Evidence chain collection (Impact, Change, Resource dimensions)
- Fault diagnosis and root cause analysis

This is a placeholder file. Actual implementation will be added in later phases.
